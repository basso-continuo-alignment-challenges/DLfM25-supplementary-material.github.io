Supplementary Materials for the Paper: Challenges in Basso Continuo Performance-to-Score Alignment

Abstract:
Basso continuo is a Baroque practice of creating harmonic improvi-
sations above a given bass line. In addition to its historical heritage,
it is also a living improvisation genre performed by most keyboard
players in historically informed performance. However, present-day
basso continuo performance has remained understudied empirically.
One key enabler for such research is an automatic system that aligns
basso continuo performances to the written bass line in the score.
This, however, presents challenges that are distinct from those of
standard performance-to-score alignment tasks, due to the under-
specificed notation of basso continuo. We analyze the specifics of
basso continuo performance-to-score alignment through a dataset
of basso continuo performances that we had previously introduced,
based on manually annotated performance-to-score alignments of
a subset of the pieces. From our analysis, we provide a compilation
of challenges specific to basso continuo performance which need
to be addressed during the alignment process.
